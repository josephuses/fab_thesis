	abstract = {With the increasing attention on improving student achievement, private tutoring has been expanding rapidly worldwide. However, the evidence on the effect of private tutoring is inconclusive for education researchers and policy makers. Employing a comprehensive dataset collected from China in 2010, this study tries to identify the effect of private tutoring on student achievement in the National College Entrance Exam ({NCEE}) of China. This study ﬁnds that private tutoring has mixed and heterogeneous effects on mathematics, Chinese language, and English language respectively and on the {NCEE} total score. The average effect of private tutoring is not signiﬁcant, but it may have a signiﬁcant and positive effect on urban students with lower achievement or in schools with certain quality. Students from schools with more educational inputs are more likely to beneﬁt from private tutoring.},

	abstract = {This study was aimed to find the predicative power of scores in mathematics paper in school based exam with the score in a test of mathematical thinking and different aspects of mathematical thinking according to their curriculum of mathematics. Additional gender wise comparison was also made. Data for this work was taken through school record and administration of test of mathematical thinking by the researcher. The specially developed test of mathematical thinking covered six aspects of thinking i.e. generalization, deduction, induction, problem solving, proofs and logical thinking. A survey method was adopted for this research with post positivist paradigm of research. A proportionate sample of 500 students was randomly selected. Statistical analysis was performed using regression and correlation techniques. The findings of this study shows that the score in the subject of mathematics during home exam was significantly correlated with the score on test of mathematical thinking overall and on separate scale as well for overall students and female students alone while this score was not consistent with the score in generalization and induction subscale for male students. Regression analysis shows that proofs and problem solving aspects of mathematical thinking were explaining the achievement of the students in the school based test more than their counter parts aspects of mathematical thinking. It was concluded that female students were showing inductive pattern while male students were deductive in their reasoning abilities.},

To date, most studies examining grit’s prediction of achievement have not included other predictors in their analyses. Therefore, we assessed grit’s incremental validity for school achievement above theoretically and empirically related predictors, in two adolescent student samples from Germany. Study 1 (N = 227) examined grit’s relative importance for students’ school grades ({GPA}, math, German) when controlling for prior school grades, the Big Five personality traits, school engagement, values, expectancies for success, and self-efficacy. In Study 2 (N = 586), intelligence, conscientiousness, and established constructs from motivation and engagement literatures were controlled to investigate grit’s relative importance for {GPA}, math grades and test performance in math. In both studies, relative weight analyses revealed that the grit subscales added little explanatory power. Results question grit’s unique prediction of scholastic success.},

We synthesized empirical evidence about 65 non-cognitive variables, which were categorized into 13 research domains of educational psychology—aﬀect, curriculum/content exposure, homework, learning and instructional time, motivation, personality traits, planned behavior, school climate, self-beliefs/social-cognitive theory, self-regulatory learning style/strategies, teacher behavior, value, and vocational interest. Our analyses showed that a group of selfbeliefs constructs, in particular, self-eﬃcacy in {PISA}, conﬁdence in {TIMSS}, and educational aspiration, in both {TIMSS} and {PISA}, were the best predictors of individual-level student achievement in mathematics. The present review supports the claim that students' projective judgements about their own ability and future selves are particularly important for their academic achievement. We discuss potential educational initiatives to maximize educational outcomes of students from diverse cultural and national backgrounds.},

For the majority of students, the {CEE} score is the single determinant in whether they gain admission into a college and to what college they enter. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether and how well the {CEE} score predicts college academic success. We also consider high school achievement and admission route in predicting college grades. We obtain administrative data on {CEE} and undergraduate {GPAs} from two Chinese universities with very different rankings. We find that, for both universities the {CEE} total score predicts undergraduate {GPAs} for all four years in college. Even the size of the estimates for {CEE} is similar for the two universities. High school achievement and admission routes are also significant predictors of college grades. However, we do not find consistent results as to which {CEE} subject test scores predict students' academic performance in college.},
