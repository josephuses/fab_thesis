## Background of the Study {#background}

The highly-varying high school quality as well as the widespread problem of high-school grade inflation makes the standardized test a fairer and more attractive tool to select students.
The NCE offers a way to identify high-potential students in low-performing high schools. NCE is an aptitude test. An aptitude test, by definition, is any type of assessment that evaluates the talent/ability/potential to perform a certain task, with no prior knowledge and/or training. 



## Statement of the Problem {#statement}

(1) How well does the NCE scores predict the RE scores? (2) Has the predictive power of the NCE changed over time? (3) Do some high school achievement indicators predict RE success? (4) is a student's admission route (i.e. principal, alternative, lateral) predictive of a particular level of performance in the RE?
