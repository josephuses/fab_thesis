Atkinson (2001) argued that SATI was less relevant to high school curriculum, and its effectiveness to predict college grade diminished when students' social economic background was controlled for. Thus he proposed that American colleges should move away from aptitude tests to achievement tests in college admission. Recently, some universities, for example, the University of California system, has made SAT optional in college application (Robinson & Monks, 2005). The CEE, as an achivement test highly related to high school curriculum, may be a better predictor of college success than a general aptitude test. However, it is contingent on whether high school curriculum is correlated with college curriculum.
